    "fictionalClientDescription": "Okanagan Artisan Interiors is a Kelowna-based interior design studio specializing in custom residential and boutique commercial spaces. They are known for their collaborative approach and a portfolio of elevated, locally inspired designs.",
    "coverHeadline": "Elevate Your Online Presence: A Digital Growth Proposal for Okanagan Artisan Interiors",
    "coverSubheadline": "Tailored Web Design & SEO Solutions for Kelowna’s Leading Interior Design Studio",
    "coverDate": "February 26, 2026",
    "clientOverview": "Okanagan Artisan Interiors has carved out a reputation in Kelowna for delivering inspired, high-end interiors that reflect both client vision and Okanagan character. With a growing portfolio of residential and boutique commercial projects, your studio has become a go-to for discerning clients seeking a collaborative, detail-driven design process. Recent word-of-mouth success and local press features have led to increased demand, and your team is now ready to invest in a digital presence that matches your brand’s elevated standards.\n\nYour current website, while functional, doesn’t fully capture the sophistication of your work or the warmth of your approach. As you look to attract more premium residential clients and expand your reach into boutique commercial projects, you recognize the need for a digital strategy that not only showcases your portfolio but actively drives qualified inquiries. You value personal partnerships and want a digital agency that will guide you transparently through this next stage of growth.",
    "problemAnalysis": "Despite your studio’s strong reputation and steady word-of-mouth referrals, your online presence is not working as hard as it could for you. The current website design is dated and lacks the visual impact and easy navigation that today’s design-savvy clients expect. Portfolio updates are cumbersome, and it’s challenging to highlight recent projects or client testimonials in a way that feels fresh and engaging. As a result, prospective clients often reach out with basic questions that could be answered online, or worse, may not reach out at all.\n\nAdditionally, your Google search visibility is limited, with competitors appearing above you for key terms like “Kelowna interior designer” and “custom commercial interiors Kelowna.” Your Google Business Profile is incomplete, and you’re not taking full advantage of local SEO or online reviews. This means you’re missing opportunities to be discovered by homeowners and business owners actively searching for your services.",
    "opportunitySection": "This is an exciting opportunity to transform Okanagan Artisan Interiors’ digital presence into a true growth engine. By investing in a modern, visually stunning website and a strategic local SEO campaign, you will not only enhance your brand perception but also attract and convert more qualified leads. Our approach prioritizes both beautiful design and exceptional user experience, ensuring visitors are inspired by your portfolio and motivated to contact your team.\n\nWith our expertise in local SEO and reputation management, we’ll position you ahead of competitors for the searches that matter most. You’ll benefit from clear, jargon-free reporting and ongoing support—empowering you to focus on your craft while we drive measurable results online. Together, we’ll build a digital foundation that supports both your immediate goals and long-term vision for growth.",
