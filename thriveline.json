    "personalization": "Urban Roots Interior Design has built a strong reputation in Kelowna for delivering thoughtfully designed interiors that blend modern aesthetics with sustainability. Your team has grown steadily through word of mouth and repeat business, and you’re now looking to attract new clients—particularly higher-value commercial projects—through a stronger online presence. You’ve invested in branding and have a basic website, but you’re ready to take things to the next level.\n\nWith competition increasing in the local interior design market, you’ve identified the need for a more polished, user-friendly website and a robust digital marketing strategy. Your goals include increasing website traffic, generating more qualified leads, and establishing Urban Roots as a top-rated choice for interior design in Kelowna and the Okanagan region. You’re seeking a partner who can provide both strategic guidance and hands-on execution, freeing up your team to focus on client projects.",
    "painStatement": "Currently, Urban Roots’ website is visually appealing but lacks the structure and optimization needed to convert visitors into inquiries. The site does not rank well for key local search terms, making it difficult for prospective clients to find you when searching for interior designers in Kelowna. There is limited tracking in place, so it’s hard to know which marketing efforts are working, and you’ve noticed that competitors are appearing more prominently in Google searches and local directories.\n\nAdditionally, your team is stretched thin, and managing digital marketing in-house has become unsustainable. You’re missing out on opportunities to showcase your best work, capture leads from Google Ads, and engage your audience consistently on platforms like Instagram. Without a proactive partner, it’s challenging to keep your web presence current and competitive.",
