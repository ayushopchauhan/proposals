    "fictionalClientName": "Oakridge Home & Garden",
    "fictionalClientIndustry": "Retail – Home and Garden",
    "fictionalClientDescription": "Oakridge Home & Garden is a well-established, family-owned retailer based in Surrey, specialising in premium outdoor furniture, gardening supplies, and lifestyle accessories. With a growing e-commerce presence, Oakridge is seeking to elevate its digital strategy to match the quality and breadth of its in-store offering.",

    "coverSubheadline": "A Data-Driven Partnership to Drive Online Sales and Measurable ROI",
    "coverDate": "February 25, 2026",
    "clientOverview": "Oakridge Home & Garden has earned a strong local reputation for its curated range of high-quality outdoor furniture, gardening tools, and seasonal home accessories. Over the past decade, you have successfully grown your brick-and-mortar presence and have recently invested in an updated e-commerce website to serve a wider UK audience. Your team is passionate about delivering an exceptional customer experience and is now focused on making your digital channels a true driver of business growth.\n\nDespite a loyal customer base and an attractive product range, Oakridge’s online sales currently account for less than 15% of total revenue. Your leadership team has identified digital as a key growth area, but recent marketing efforts have produced inconsistent results. You are seeking a trusted partner to help you understand your digital performance, identify opportunities, and systematically grow your online sales and lead generation.",
    "problemAnalysis": "Oakridge Home & Garden’s current digital marketing is fragmented, with a mix of in-house and outsourced activities producing mixed outcomes. Website analytics show high bounce rates and low conversion rates, particularly on mobile devices. Paid advertising campaigns have generated traffic, but too often fail to convert visitors into customers, and attribution of sales to specific channels remains unclear.\n\nYour email database is underutilised, with infrequent campaigns and minimal segmentation, resulting in low open and click-through rates. Social media engagement is strong locally, but lacks the consistency and targeting required to drive e-commerce sales. The lack of a cohesive, data-driven digital strategy is limiting Oakridge’s ability to leverage its brand and product strengths in the online marketplace.",
    "opportunitySection": "There is a significant opportunity for Oakridge to systematically improve digital performance through a comprehensive, data-driven approach. By analysing user behaviour, optimising your website for conversions, and implementing targeted, measurable campaigns across paid, organic, and owned channels, we can unlock sustainable online sales growth.\n\nOur proven business formula focuses on removing guesswork and relying on test-and-measure strategies to ensure every marketing pound delivers ROI. With Supplyant as your partner, Oakridge will gain both the strategic insight and hands-on execution needed to build a high-performing digital sales engine. We will work alongside your team to transform your website into a primary sales channel, deepen customer engagement, and establish a foundation for ongoing growth.",
