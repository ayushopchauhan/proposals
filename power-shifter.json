    "company_description": "POWER SHIFTER is a digital product and service design studio that partners with leading brands & scaleups to produce digital products — applications, mobile apps, and websites — that unlock the greatest amount of value possible for your brand's digital touch-points. \n\nFor many companies, from startup to enterprise, it's hard to allocate the in-house time and talent and support the agile and iterative culture, required to build the calibre of application needed. It's even harder to do it fast enough that a competitor doesn't get there first — or worse, do it better. \n\nOur passionate team lives and breathes product design every single day, it's all we do and have been doing for more than ten years. We have partnered with numerous companies and used Design Thinking processes to make the complex, simple. Achieving simplicity for your digital products is never easy, but it wins the hearts, minds, and brand loyalty of your customers: 64% of customers are willing to pay more for your products & services when they are simple and easy to use, and 61% of customers are more likely to recommend your brand because it provides simpler experiences.",
